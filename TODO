This is a list of items and ideas that might be useful to add.

	Fix autogen script... too many irrelevant messages being generated, 
find root cause.

-Documentation
	
	Can not install xmlto (any) application.  I will write up 
suitable documentation covering the current api once this has been 
resolved.  (I need to upgrade docbook-xls and friends).

-Callbacks
	
	Have a routine that watches for change in 
/proc/tty/driver/usbserial which can then call data in a report to a function 
specified by the programmer.  This will be handy for hotplugging, etc.

-Misc.

	Convert current node LIFO stack into a FIFO.  Add naming scheme 
to beginning pointer, and a new or unified node list for 'serial' 
information.  The current parser should be able to handle the 'serial' 
proc information, as it is in the same format.

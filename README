INSTALLATION:

	Please refer to the file 'INSTALL' for standard configuration 
and installation instructions.

To compile the test program:

$ make test

Now run it with a 4 digit vendor and product id to look for.

$ ./test xxxx xxxx

Make sure the device is connected (or not)

DOCUMENTATION:

	Doxygen generated documentation is available in the html folder.
Please refer to the test program  within the library or content within
'examples' as well.  A contrib folder will be set up should code be
submitted to the project.  The man pages are very messy... I'm still
experimenting with doxyfile settings.
